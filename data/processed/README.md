# Data Management Practices
This directory (data/processed) is used for storing processed and transformed data that is ready for use by the ACME-LO project's src/database and src/models components.

# Data Formats
The processed data stored in this directory is typically in structured formats suitable for analysis and modeling. Common formats include:

 - CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
 - HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format)
 - Pickle files (for Python objects)

# Storage Conventions

To maintain organization and traceability, we follow the following storage conventions:

Each dataset is stored in its own subdirectory within data/processed.
Filenames are descriptive and include relevant metadata, such as the date of processing or data source.

# Preprocessing Steps

Data in this directory has undergone preprocessing and transformation steps to prepare it for analysis and modeling. These steps may include:

 - Feature engineering and selection
 - Data aggregation and summarization
 - Dimensionality reduction techniques
 - Scaling and normalization

# Data Privacy and Security

Even in its processed form, data in this directory may contain sensitive or private information. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain data privacy and security practices:

 - Access to this directory should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
 - Continue to comply with relevant data protection regulations.
 - Implement appropriate access controls and encryption measures.
 - Periodically review and update data privacy policies.

# Usage by src/database and src/models

The data stored in data/processed serves as the input for the src/database component, where it may be used for database population, querying, and retrieval.
The src/models component may utilize the processed data for model training, testing, and evaluation. It is essential to maintain data integrity and consistency to ensure reliable model performance.
